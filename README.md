# Swift-iPod
iOS app thatâ€™s goal is to replicate the core features of an iPod with the songs a user has stored in the Files App.

### Why I made it: 
Ever sinice the death of iTunes iOS users have had no built-in way to nicely make playlist from, listen to, and view music they have downloaded on their devices. 
Since the introduction of the Files app we have been able to download files right from safari, maing it easy to download music that's unavailble on streaming services 
like free mixtapes from [Datpiff.com](https://www.datpiff.com/), or music you bought by supporting an indie artist on [bandcamp.com](https://bandcamp.com/).
The only problem being the Files app doesn't have basic features like making playlists, skipping songs, or even just having the next song in the folder play after the first song finishes.
This app was my response to that and a way for me to improve my iOS dev skills.
